# Workflow Templates

Reusable Workflow Templates can be placed here for re-use across the organization. Workflow templates will require two files, the workflow itself `.yml` and a properties file that is named the exact same but extension is `.properties.json` instead of `.yml`. An example has been added to this folder at [webhalo-example-ci.yml](webhalo-example-ci.yml) and [webhalo-example-ci.properties.json](webhalo-example-ci.properties.json).
