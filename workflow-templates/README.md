# Workflow Templates

## Overview

Reusable Workflow Templates can be placed here for re-use across the organization. Workflow templates will require two files, the workflow itself `.yml` and a properties file that is named the exact same but extension is `.properties.json` instead of `.yml`. An example has been added to this folder at [webhalo-example-ci.yml](webhalo-example-ci.yml) and [webhalo-example-ci.properties.json](webhalo-example-ci.properties.json).

## Usage

When creating 

You can find any workflow templates under Actions > New workflow > Workflows created by webhalo when creating from a template in this organization for any repositories in this organization.
